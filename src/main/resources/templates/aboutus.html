        <p class="col-lg-11" style="margin: auto 30px; font-size: 20px;">Hawker food culture is an integral part of
            Singapore's culinary heritage, with a diverse range of local dishes and flavors that reflect the nation's
            multiculturalism. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of an online presence for food
            hawkers in Singapore. With social distancing measures in place and a decrease in foot traffic at physical
            locations, many food hawkers have had to adapt to survive. <br/><br/>

            We hope to encourage more food hawkers to have an online presence to reach a wider audience and increase
            their visibility in the competitive food industry. As consumers are increasingly turning to online platforms
            to discover new food options and make purchases, having an online presence will allow food hawkers to
            showcase their offerings, share their stories, and connect with customers beyond their physical location.
